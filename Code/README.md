# Code Folder Instructions

## 0. CSV files and folders 
* The CSV files contains the images and their relative IDs. The train.csv and sample_submission.csv are the original data files, and others are generated by data_process.py. 
* The train folder contains the training images.
* The test folder contains the testing images.

## 1. data_process.py

This Python file should be implemented at first to generate cleaned training data and the oversampled data CSV files. As the generated files already exist here,
this part could be skipped.

## 2. Train.py

This Python file should be secondly implemented, which contains cleaned training and validation data loading and processing, steps of network setting and training, and the best model saving.  

## 3. Test.py

This Python file should be implemented at last. It contains steps of test and validation data loading and processing, network loading, model testing (mean average precision computing), label predictions, and submit file generation.
