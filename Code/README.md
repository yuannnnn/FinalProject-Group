## Project Summary
The project is to build a deep learning model to identify different whale species by recognizing the shape of whalesâ€™ tails and unique markings found in footage using over 25,000 images stored in a database called Happy Whale. The human activity of killing whales for oil and food has decreased the population of whales in the world, especially humpback whales. For a long time, oceanographers and marine scientists have photo surveilled ocean activity to keep a log on the population of whales, but this is a slow and work-intensive way of manually keeping a record. Therefore, a faster and more effective way of identifying whale species could help a lot.
